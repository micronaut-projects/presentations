# Agenda

* Background that led to Micronaut
* Introduction to Micronaut 2.0
* Micronaut Demos!
* Q & A!

----




# Serverless Challenges

* Challenges to optimize Java for Serverless / Microservices scenarios
* Existing Tools and Frameworks Not designed for Cold Starts / Low Memory
* Go, Node etc. better in this regards

----




# Microservice Challenges

* Write once run anywhere no longer as relevent with containers
* The Container is the deployment unit
* Containers and Java require special memory management
* Native images can lead to better resource utilization and lower costs

# Traditional Frameworks



[.hide-footer]

Traditional frameworks like Spring, CDI etc. make extensive use of techniques that are bad for memory consumption and startup performance:

* Reflection
* Runtime Byte Code Generation
* Runtime Generated Proxies
* Dynamic Class Loading
* Classpath scanning

---

# The Micro Reality

![RIGHT](images/elephant.jpg)

[.hide-footer]

* Frameworks based on reflection
and annotations become fat
* But we love the programming
model and productivity so
we live with it
* You can turn these features off, but then 
the drop in productivity is massive
* What is the value of Spring without autoconfiguration?

# Java's Problems for Frameworks

* Limited Annotation API
* Type Erasure
* Slow Reflection
* Reflective Data Caches
* Classpath Scanning
* Slow Dynamic Class Loading

# Why is Reflection a Problem?

* Today the JDK is OpenJDK!
* Just take a look...

> https://github.com/openjdk/jdk/blob/e2196f8882b9237926c3ff208bc971c5c31faac7/src/java.base/share/classes/java/lang/Class.java#L3125 

* **All** Reflective data initialized on first access and held in soft references (yes every field, method etc.)
* Won't be GC'ed until your application is low on memory!

---

# Already Solved Problem

* The Android Community already solved the problem
* Ahead of Time Compilation used extensively
* Google Dagger 2.x
	* Compile Time Dependency Injector
	* Reflection Free
	* Limited in Scope to just DI

<!-- # Introducing Micronaut -->

----



# Micronaut is...

* A Microservices and Serverless Focused framework (hence the branding)
* Also a Complete Application Framework for any type of Application
* Dependency Injection, Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP), Configuration Management,
 Bean Introspection and more..


![right, 95%](images/micronaut-space.png)

----

# Micronaut Precomputation

* All Dependency & Configuration Injection
* Annotation Metadata (Meta annotations)
* AOP Proxies
* Bean Introspections
* And all other framework infrastructure
* Essentially what Spring/CDI do at runtime

![right, 95%](images/micronaut-space.png)

----


# With Micronaut You Can Build

* Microservices
* Serverless Applications
* Message-Driven Applications with Kafka/Rabbit
* CLI Applications
* Even Android Applications
* Anything with
	`static void main(String..args)`

----



# So What is Micronaut? Really?

* An Application Framework for the Future
* Reflection Free, Runtime Proxy Free,
  No Dynamic Classloading
* Ahead of Time (AOT) Compilation AOT APIs
* ... oh and let's you build Microservices

# Micronaut's Impact

* Micronaut was announced on March 2018
* Open Sourced 28th of May 2018 
* Sparked industry wide improvements from Red Hat (with Quarkus) and VMware (Spring Boot 2.2+	)
* Micronaut is changing the face of server side Java

# Micronaut and GraalVM

* A New Universal Virtual Machine from Oracle
* Features a `native-image` Tool
	* Converts Java -> native machine code using AOT
* Works great with Micronaut!
* Startup time 20ms and Memory Consumption 18MB!

# Micronaut and GraalVM

* Micronaut + GraalVM Native Image are a match made in heaven
* So much so I now work at Oracle Labs :)
* Less work to configure Native Image because Micronaut eliminates reflection, runtime proxies, byte code generation and dynamic classloading
