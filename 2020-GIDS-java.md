# Agenda

* Background that led to Micronaut
* Introduction to Micronaut
* Micronaut Demos!
* Q & A!

----




# Serverless Challenges

* Challenges to optimize Java for Serverless / Microservices scenarios
* Existing Tools and Frameworks Not designed for Cold Starts / Low Memory
* Go, Node etc. better in this regards
* Containerization and Virtualization aggrevate the problem

----




# Adapting to Serverless

* Optimize for cold starts
* Forget about connection pools
* Don't bother with local caches
* Choose technology based on your cold start requirements

----




# Adapting to Microservices

* Cold starts less important, but still important
* The Container is the deployment unit
* Containers and Java require special memory management
* Optimization for memory usage required

# Traditional Frameworks



[.hide-footer]

Traditional frameworks like Spring, CDI etc. make extensive use of techniques that are bad for memory consumption and startup performance:

* Reflection
* Runtime Byte Code Generation
* Runtime Generated Proxies
* Dynamic Class Loading

---

# The Micro Reality

![RIGHT](images/elephant.jpg)

[.hide-footer]

* Frameworks based on reflection
and annotations become fat
* But we love the programming
model and productivity so
we live with it
* So ... why should we be
more efficient?

# Java's Problems for Frameworks

* Limited Annotation API
* Type Erasure
* Slow Reflection
* Reflective Data Caches
* Classpath Scanning
* Slow Dynamic Class Loading

![right, 20%](images/java.png)


----


# Why is Reflection a Problem?

* Today the JDK is OpenJDK!
* Just take a look...

> http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk8/jdk8/jdk/file/687fd7c7986d/src/share/classes/java/lang/Class.java#l2471

* **All** Reflective data initialized on first access and held in soft references (yes every field, method etc.)
* Won't be GC'ed until your application is low on memory!

---

# Already Solved Problem

* The Android Community already solved the problem
* Ahead of Time Compilation used extensively
* Google Dagger 2.x
	* Compile Time Dependency Injector
	* Reflection Free
	* Limited in Scope to just DI

<!-- # Introducing Micronaut -->

----



# Micronaut is...

* A Microservices and Serverless Focused framework (hence the branding)
* Also a Complete Application Framework for any type of Application
* Dependency Injection, Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP), Configuration Management,
 Bean Introspection and more..


![right, 95%](images/micronaut-space.png)

----

# Micronaut Precomputation

* All Dependency & Configuration Injection
* Annotation Metadata (Meta annotations)
* AOP Proxies
* Bean Introspections
* And all other framework infrastructure
* Essentially what Spring/CDI do at runtime

![right, 95%](images/micronaut-space.png)

----


# With Micronaut You Can Build

* Microservices
* Serverless Applications
* Message-Driven Applications with Kafka/Rabbit
* CLI Applications
* Even Android Applications
* Anything with
	`static void main(String..args)`

----



# So What is Micronaut? Really?

* An Application Framework for the Future
* Reflection Free, Runtime Proxy Free,
  No Dynamic Classloading
* Ahead of Time (AOT) Compilation AOT APIs
* ... oh and let's you build Microservices

# Micronaut's Impact

* We announced Micronaut on March 2018
* Open Sourced 28th of May 2018 (a year ago!)
* Sparked industry wide improvements from Red Hat (with Quarkus) and VMware (Spring Boot 2.2+	)
* Micronaut is changing the face of server side Java

![right, 95%](images/micronaut-space.png)

----


# Micronaut and GraalVM

* A New Universal Virtual Machine from Oracle
* Features a `native-image` Tool
	* Converts Java -> native machine code using AOT
* Works great with Micronaut!
* Startup time 20ms and Memory Consumption 18MB!

# Micronaut and GraalVM

* Micronaut + GraalVM Native Image are a much made in heaven
* So much so I now work at Oracle Labs :)
* Less to configure because Micronaut eliminates reflection, runtime proxies, byte code generation and dynamic classloading
